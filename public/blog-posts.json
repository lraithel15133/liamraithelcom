Then, I spent some time working on the simple javascript code for my Local Pastebin project. I made myself a little logo, and now I am brainstorming ideas for my next projects."

Currently it is all held in a JSON file. My next project is learning MongoDB usage and maybe even making a backend portal for me to make blog posts on."

I understand JavaScript OK, but full stack web dev is the goal, so that is what I am focusing on. Still working on that, but my CSS is moving along quickly. I'll work on styling the webpage and maybe focus on some more small projects."
