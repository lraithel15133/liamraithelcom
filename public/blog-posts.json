Then, I spent some time working on the simple javascript code for my Local Pastebin project. I made myself a little logo, and now I am brainstorming ideas for my next projects."

Currently it is all held in a JSON file. My next project is learning MongoDB usage and maybe even making a backend portal for me to make blog posts on."

            "content": "I have spent the better part of the last month relearning CSS and HTML. I started to do some work on JavaScript and quickly realized I needed to go back to the basics. I understand JavaScript OK, but full stack web dev is the goal, so that is what I am focusing on. Still working on that, but my CSS is moving along quickly. I'll work on styling the webpage and maybe focus on some more small projects."

And then on July 1st I started college at WGU and transferred in 35% of a BS. I'm aiming to finish as fast as possible. Oh! I also rewrote a discord bot I made (MovieNightBot) to use SQLite which was a fun practical learning exercise for an SQL class I was taking."

	   "content": "I made a little belt tension calculator and put it up on Github pages. The reason its on github pages is I have made it for a friends business, and the page its hosted on is static elements. I ended up putting it in an iframe and loading it on the page. Heres the link, I am quite proud of it! https://lraithel15133.github.io/beltcalculator/ and http://lukeslab.info/en/belt-tension-guide"
